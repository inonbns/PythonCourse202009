Uri's comments:
==============

* Very good! This code works.
* In Python it's common to use variable names in lowercase. You can use "_" to separate between words.
  For example, use "age" instead of "Age".
  This is relevant to all your exercises.
* You can add comments with three quotation marks, however there is no need for an empty comment.
* It's better to end a Python file with a line break.
  If you use PyCharm's Code -> Reformat Code feature, it will be done automatically.
  This is relevant to all your exercises.
